# Training and association testing with DeepRVAT

*TODO:* Overview of procedure, multiple flavors (with training, with pretrained models, with precomputed burdens, with/without REGENIE)


## Configuration file: Common parameters

*TODO:* Describe common parameters, give example


## Training

### Configuration file

### Running the training pipeline


## Association testing

### Configuration file

### Running the association testing pipeline with REGENIE

### Running the association testing pipeline with SEAK


## Training and association testing with a combined pipeline

### Configuration file

### Running the training and association testing pipeline with REGENIE

### Running the training and association testing pipeline with SEAK


## Running only a portion of any pipeline

*TODO:* Point to modular breakdowns of pipelines
