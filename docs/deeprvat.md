# Training and association testing with DeepRVAT

*TODO:* Overview of procedure, multiple flavors (with training, with pretrained models, with precomputed burdens, with/without REGENIE)


## Input data: Common requirements for all pipelines


## Configuration file: Common parameters

*TODO:* Describe common parameters, give example


## Training

### Input data

### Configuration file

### Running the training pipeline


## Association testing

### Input data

### Configuration file

### Running the association testing pipeline with REGENIE

### Running the association testing pipeline with SEAK

### Association testing using precomputed burdens

*TODO:* With and without REGENIE

## Training and association testing with a combined pipeline

### Input data and configuration file

*TODO:* Everything required for each separate one descibed above

### Running the training and association testing pipeline

*TODO:* With and without REGENIE

## Running only a portion of any pipeline

*TODO:* Point to modular breakdowns of pipelines
