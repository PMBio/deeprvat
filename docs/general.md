# General considerations

## Pipeline resource requirements

*TODO:* Note that pipelines have some suggested resource requirements, may need to be adjusted for cluster execution


## Cluster execution

*TODO:* Point to snakemake profiles


## Execution on GPU vs. CPU

*TODO:* Two rules that use GPU. Training pretty much requires GPU, burden computation is okay on CPU but substantially slower


## *TODO:* Add any other points?
